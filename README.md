## Hi there! 👋

I am a developer at Citizens Advice, working on Casebook - their CRM tool. After finishing my coding bootcamp at [Maker](https://makers.tech/) I was at Abelson Info for just under a year working mostly with Ruby on Rails (versions 2.3 - 6). Before coding I trained as an accountant, latterly working in personal tax, and worked in social housing before that. 

Find out more about my experience and aspirations over on my [GitHub CV](https://github.com/stringiest/CV) or scroll down to check-out some of my favourite projects.

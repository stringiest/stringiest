## Hi there! 👋

I'm a software developer at Abelson Info and am really enjoying getting to grips with our 30 or so apps, which stretch through from Rails 3 to Rails 6 (with the odd Python app thrown in for good measure)! I came to this role after completing a coding bootcamp at [Makers](https://makers.tech/). Prior to that I was a tax accountant.
